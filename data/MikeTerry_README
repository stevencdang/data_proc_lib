The data set is split across two files. instances.csv is each response to a brainstorming question. trees.csv dictates the structure of the idea forests. A great deal of redundant information in encoded across both. This README summarizes the fields in each CSV.

instances.csv
=============
Each record is for a single instance. However, each record also contains information associated with the idea node containing the instance and the category tree containing that idea node. The record also contains information associated with the brainstorming run.

worker_id - a unique identifier for each worker
question - the text of the question asked
question_code - a string identifier for each brainstorming question
post_date - the date the task was posted on Mechanical Turk. Not reliable.
screenshot - a file name for a screenshot of the task. Not reliable.
num_requested - the number of responses requested
answer_num - the order the response appeared in the worker's brainstorming run
answer - the natural language response given
word_count - the number of words in the answer
start_time - the time the answer started in milleseconds
end_time - the time the answer ended in milleseconds
answer_code - ignore field
submit_datetime - date and time the HIT was submitted
accept_datetime - date and time the HIT was accepted
worker_num - a unique number identifier for each worker
is_repeat_worker - whether this answer is in the second or later run completed by a single worker
answer_id - an ID identifier for the answer used by the coding application
idea - which idea node the instance belongs to
answer_clus - I don't remember, I don't use this
post_date_clus - I don't remember, I don't use this
depth_in_subtree - the distance in hops from the root of the cluster tree to the idea associated with this instance
height_in_subtree - the "level" of the tree the idea is in. Imagine the tree resting on its lowermost leaf, and then count up rows
idea_label - a plain text label for the idea node
idea_probability - the proportion of the corpus for this question that this idea represents
is_leaf - whether the idea node is a leaf
is_root - whether the idea node is a root
num_children - the number of children of the idea node
num_ideas_under - the number descendents of the idea node
num_instances - the number of instances associated with the idea node
num_instances_under - the number of instances associated with the idea node and all descendants
num_nodes_under - same as num_ideas_under
num_workers - the number of workers who came up with the same idea
parent - the parent idea of the idea node
subtree_probability - the probability of an instance being associated with the category tree
subtree_root - the root of the idea's tree
subtree_oscore - originality/novelty score for the category tree
idea_oscore - originality/novelty score for the idea node
time_spent - time spent generating the instance
distance_from_similar - distance from a similar idea in a brainstorming run, according to a concept of riffing (an idea is a riff of another if it is a descendent or ancestor of that idea)
is_inmix - whether the idea is ever riffed on AND is not a riff itself
is_midmix - whether the idea  is ever riffed on
is_outmix - whether the idea is a riff
distance_from_inmix - distance from the original idea in the riff chain
previous_similar_inmix - I don't remember, I don't use this
inmix_index - I don't remember, I don't use this
num_received - actual number of ideas received in this run


trees.csv
=========
This CSV encodes the tree structure. Each record represents a single idea node. Every field is also in instances.csv, to make it easier to work with.
